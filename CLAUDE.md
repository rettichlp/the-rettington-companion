# The Rettington Companion

See [README.md](README.md) for what it does, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build/setup, project structure, code style, and
branching/PR conventions — follow that instead of improvising here. Community behavior expectations are in
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Manual testing

GUI/in-game changes are **not** tested automatically — don't try to join a world or automate the client window. `./gradlew build` is
enough to confirm a change compiles; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-your-changes) for how the client itself gets tested.
